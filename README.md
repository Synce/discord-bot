Free Speech to Text Recognition services aren't good enough for this type of bot. Currnetly abandoned project with working basics like playing music from yt and finding spotify music on yt.
Text commands:
!play (only english titles)
!skip
!next (but u should say mix beacuse most of the time bot recognizes "next" as "mix" so i changed command)
